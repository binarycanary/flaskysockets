### Barebones SPA template for websockets communication with flask

This has been done countless times already.. I did my own to learn more about websockets and to keep it dead simple and stripped down. Gevent intentionally not included. My goal was to make it easy to integrate into something like a initializr.com template.

Built using input from blogs, stackoverflow, etc:
